# Scientific Code Repository

This repository contains a collection of scripts I have developed during my time in previous research labs. These scripts are made available freely for use by the scientific and research community.

Please note that my DEXseq, DESeq2 script, and REDItools pipeline are not currently included in this repository.

Feel free to explore the available resources. Any feedback or suggestions are always appreciated.

## Thanks  

Special thanks to Dr. Isabelle Schrauwen for her invaluable guidance and support.
